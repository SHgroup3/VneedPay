<p>In addition to the specific situations discussed elsewhere in this privacy notice, we disclose personal data in the following circumstances:</p>

<p>We may ask that you provide biometric data to one of our identity verification providers. Where data protection laws only permit the processing of biometric data with your consent, we will seek your consent prior to the processing.</p>
<p>For example, in order to verify your identity, Vneed Pay uses the services of Onfido. Onfido will check if your identity documents are valid, and also confirm that your selfie photo and/or video matches the photo on the documents and may process your biometric information per <a class="f11qm70v" href="https://onfido.com/facial-scan-policy-and-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Onfido’s Facial Scan and Voice Recording Policy</a> and <a class="f11qm70v" href="https://onfido.com/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Onfido’s Privacy Policy</a>. The results of the check will then be shared with Vneed Pay. Your photo and ID documents will be shared with Onfido for this purpose as well as to allow Onfido to maintain, protect and improve its services.</p>
<h2 id="do-we-make-automated-decisions-about-you"><strong>DO WE MAKE AUTOMATED DECISIONS ABOUT YOU?</strong></h2>
<p>We use automated processes to check that your access to our services and your use of our services meet our required standard, including verifying your identity, and to help prevent fraud or other illegal activities. These processes may make an automated decision to reject your proposed transaction, to block a suspicious attempt to log into your account, or to close your account. If you feel that an automated process may have impacted you, please contact our Privacy team at <a class="f11qm70v" href="mailto:privacy@remitly.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">privacy@VneedPay.com</a>.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-my-privacy-rights"><strong>WHAT ARE MY PRIVACY RIGHTS?</strong></h2>
<p>Our customers in certain regions of the world have specific data privacy rights based upon the applicable privacy laws and regulations. We strive to implement the best privacy practices as a standard for all our customers.</p>
<p><em>Access Your Data &amp; Data Portability</em></p>
<p>You may request that we provide you a copy of your personal data processed by us. This information will be provided without undue delay subject to certain exceptions or limitations, including if such provision adversely affects the rights and freedoms of others.</p>
<p><em>Correct Your Data / Data Rectification</em></p>
<p>You have the right to request that we update and correct inaccuracies in your personal data. You can update certain information related to your account by logging into your account on our site or app, as applicable or otherwise contacting us as described in the Exercising Your Privacy Rights section below.</p>
<p><em>Data Deletion/Erasure</em></p>
<p>You may request to erase your personal data, subject to applicable law. If you close your account, we will mark your account in our database as "Closed," but will keep certain account information for a period of time. This is necessary to deter fraud, by ensuring that persons who try to commit fraud will not be able to avoid detection simply by closing their account and opening a new account, and to comply with our legal obligations. However, if you close your account, your personal data will not be used by us for any further purposes, nor shared with third parties, except as necessary to prevent fraud and assist law enforcement, as required by law, or in accordance with this Notice.</p>
<p><em>Object to the Processing of Data</em></p>
<p>You have the right to object to us processing or transferring your personal data under certain circumstances. You may object to any processing based on the legitimate interests ground when there is something about your particular situation where you feel processing on this ground impacts your fundamental rights and freedoms.</p>
<p><em>Unsubscribe from Direct Marketing</em></p>
<p>You have the right to ask us not to process your personal information for marketing purposes. You can exercise this right at any time by carrying out 'unsubscribe' actions which are made available to you (such as clicking on the 'unsubscribe' link in each promotional email we send you). We will honor your choice and refrain from sending you such communications. Please note that if you ask us not to contact you by email at a certain email address, we will retain a copy of that email address on a "suppression list" in order to comply with your no-contact request. You are free to change your marketing choices at any time.</p>
<p>You may also control how we use some of your personal data as part of our Services (such as how we may communicate with you) by confirming your preferences in your Account. Please note that not all communications can be switched off -- for example, we may be required to send you email notices about our Services to comply with our legal obligations under national laws and regulatory guidance.</p>
<p><em>Automated Individual Decision-Making, Including Profiling</em></p>
<p>In some jurisdictions, you have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing of your personal data, including profiling, which produces legal or similarly significant effects on you, unless there are  applicable exceptions under relevant data protection laws. We may reject your request, as permitted by applicable law, including when providing the information would result in a disclosure of a trade secret or would interfere with the prevention or detection of fraud or other crime. However, generally in these circumstances we will verify that the algorithm and source data are functioning as anticipated without error or bias or if required by law to adjust the processing.</p>
<p><em>Withdraw Your Consent</em></p>
<p>You have the right to withdraw your consent for us to process data, where our lawful basis for processing is based on that consent. Note that withdrawal of consent does not affect the lawfulness of processing which may have taken place prior to withdrawal of consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you.</p>
<p><em>US Oregon Residents: List of Third Parties</em></p>
<p>If you are a resident of the state of Oregon, you have the right to obtain, at our option, a list of specific third parties, other than natural persons, to which we have disclosed: (i) your personal data or (ii) any personal data.</p>
<p>Exercising Your Privacy Rights</p>
<p>To exercise any of the above privacy rights, please submit a request<br/>through one of the following methods:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sending us an email at <a class="f11qm70v" href="mailto:privacy@remitly.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">privacy@VneedPay.com</a> using the email associated with your Vneed Pay account; or</li>
<li><a class="f11qm70v" href="https://www.remitly.com/ca/en/help#contact" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Contacting us</a> via Chat or Phone.</li>
</ul>
<p>We typically do not charge a fee for exercising your privacy rights, but where permitted by law, we may charge a reasonable fee for requests that are excessive or manifestly unfounded.</p>
<p><em>Identity Verification</em></p>
<p>For us to process some requests, we will need to verify your identity to confirm that the request came from you. We may contact you by phone or e-mail to verify your request. If we are unable to contact you or you fail to respond to our requests to identify you, we may be unable to fulfill your request.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-we-protect-your-data"><strong>HOW DO WE PROTECT YOUR DATA?</strong></h2>
<p>We employ industry accepted technical and organizational measures to protect the information you submit to us. We protect your sensitive personal data such as bank account number, credit card number, date of birth, and government identification number using encryption in transit and encryption at rest. We leverage access controls to limit access to personal data to those with a need to know. We also require the use of security credentials (which may, for example, include a username and password) from each user who wants to access their information on our Site and/or our App.</p>
<p>Where we have given you (or you have chosen) security credentials (such as a password) that enable you to access certain parts of our Service, you are responsible for keeping these details confidential and secure. Moreover, if you allow access to our Services via using your fingerprint on your Device (for example, via Apple Touch ID), then you should not allow any other person to register their fingerprint on that Device as it may allow them access to our Services and you could be held responsible for their actions. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security and any transmission of personal information is at your own risk. If you have any questions about security, you can contact us at <a class="f11qm70v" href="mailto:privacy@remitly.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">privacy@VneedPay.com</a>.</p>
<p> This site is protected by <a class="f11qm70v" href="https://cloud.google.com/security/products/recaptcha#protect-against-fraud-and-abuse-with-a-modern-fraud-prevention-platform" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">reCAPTCHA Enterprise</a> and the <a class="f11qm70v" href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Google Privacy Policy</a> and <a class="f11qm70v" href="https://policies.google.com/terms" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Terms of Service</a> apply.</p>
<h2 id="transferring-personal-data-internationally"><strong>TRANSFERRING PERSONAL DATA INTERNATIONALLY</strong></h2>
<p>We share your personal data within the Vneed Pay family of products, including Vneed Pay Group entities and subsidiaries, and to external third parties (the categories of which are referred to in this Notice). This may involve transferring your personal data internationally including outside of the country of your residence. Whenever we transfer your personal data internationally we will ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it. In some instances, your personal information may be transferred to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the applicable data protection authority or government agency (as specified in the Our Relationship With You section below). In other instances, we will ensure at least one of the lawful safeguards are implemented, which may include the use of intra-company agreements, contractual protections, or specific contracts approved (such as standard contractual clauses) by the applicable data protection authority or government agency (as specified in the Our Relationship With You section below), which give personal data the same protection it has in your country of residence.</p>
<h2 id="how-long-do-we-retain-your-data"><strong>HOW LONG DO WE RETAIN YOUR DATA?</strong></h2>
<p>We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting or reporting requirements. To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the following based upon your country of residence (among other things):</p>
<ul>
<li>obligations and/or retention periods imposed on us by applicable laws and/or our regulators</li>
<li>the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data</li>
<li>the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, and</li>
<li>the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means.</li>
